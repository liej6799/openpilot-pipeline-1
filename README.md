# openpilot-pipeline

Comma AI's Advanced Driver-Assitance System (ADAS) [Openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is open-source, but the code to create training data and train the models is not. We attempt to re-create & open-source their full pipeline.

## About @nikebless
- where this project is right now? (distillation only, no true training)

## Model
The neural network architecurre of the model consists of a Convolutional feature extractor which is a Resnet based custom feature extractor, followed by a GRU (used to capture the temporal context) and at the end we have different outputs heads which comprises of fully connnected layers responisble for outputs like paths, lanelines road edges and other meta information which is explained in detail below.

The model visualized above is taken from [Openpilot 0.8.10 Release](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/v0.8.10/models) and you can find the same 'supercombo.onnx' model in this [repository ](https://github.com/nikebless/openpilot-pipeline/tree/main/common/models). 

The visualization tool used for onnx architecures: [netron](https://github.com/lutzroeder/netron) and the installation instructions can be found under the parent repository.

Detailed definations of the inputs and outputs of the model are mentioned [here](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/models). 
### Inputs
As mentioned above we can divide the model architecture into two parts encoder and decoder. Where the encoder part is made up of CNN feature extractor and a GRU, whereas decoder is mutliheaded fully connected layers responsible for outputs. 

The primary input to the model are two consecutive frames which are converted into YUV 4:2:0 format and stacked to form a tensor of shape $(1,12,128,256)$
* ##### YUV 4:2:0
  * It is a color subsampling technique.
  * Ecodes only 20% of the color infromation.
  * Saves memory footprint
  * Computationally efficient. 

Apart from the images there are three more inputs which are fed to the model in the intermediate stage where extracted features are passed into the GRU. So the GRU takes in extracted CNN features, desire, traffic convention and recurrent state. 
* ##### Desire
  * Desire in general for one sample is a 1-D vector with shape of $(1,8)$. In simpler terms it can be interpreted by the desirable actions performed by the driver during a drive scenario when openpilot is engaged. 
![desire](images/desire.png?raw=true)
More concrete infromation can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/commaai/cereal/blob/5c64eaab789dfa67a210deaa2530788843474999/log.capnp). 
* ##### Traffic Convention
  * As similar to desire for one sample it is a 1-D vector of shape $(1,2)$ which is one hot encoded according to the LHD(Right Hand Driving) and RHD(Right Hand Driving). 
* ##### Recurrent State
  * This is basically taken from the output of the network which is refeed again to the the GRU. 

### Outputs
At the last part of the architecure all the ouputs from the fully connected branches are concatenated, thus the output of the model is of shape $(n,6472)$ where n is the batch size.
The output vector is parsed according to index and the outputs can be obtained. The method to parse the output vector can be found in the older versions of the [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/v0.8.5/selfdrive/modeld/models/driving.cc) and can be obtained [via](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/models). All the outputs are predicted in the form of mean, standard deviation and logits and regressed over time. All the predictions like path plans, lanelines, road_edges  are carried out for future 33 timestamps which spans upto 10 seconds from the current frame and each time stamp is associated with a distance from 0 to 192 meters. You can find the refference for that in the openpilot code with arguments named **T_IDXS** and **X_IDXS**. All the outputs from the model are predicted in comma's so called calibrated frame of refference, which is explained in detail [here](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/common/transformations).
* ##### Paths Plans
  * The model predicts 5 potential desired plans with the shape of $(n, 4955)$, which can be further splitted into 5 equal arrays with shape (1,991). 
  * Further $(1,991)$ is divided into paths and path probabilty.
  * Each path is associated with a probability.
  * To obtain the actual meaningful arrays for one path (1,990) can be reshaped to (1,2,33,15).
  * $[:, 0, :, :]$ = mean and  std = $[:, 1, :, :]$, for the following values.
  
* ##### Lanelines 
  * Modle predicts 4 potential lanelines, where the shape of the parsed vector is $(n,528)$.
  * This $(n,528)$ can be further reshaped into $(4,2,33,2)$.
  * The four lanelines can be named as outer_left, inner_left, inner_right, outer_right.
  * The ego vehicle is always in the middle lane(inner_left and inner_right).
* ##### Laneline Probabilites 
  * Probability that each of the 4 lanes exist.
* ##### Road Edges
  * Model predicts two road edges left and right. 

* ##### Leads
* ##### Leads Probabilites 
* ##### Desire State

* ##### Meta

* ##### Pose

* ##### Recurrent State


### Technicalities: onnx2pytorch @nikebless

### Loss functions
- As mentioned above we are doing model distillation and currently training for just paths. All the predictions are in the terms of mean, standard deviation and logits. So we are first creating distribution [objects](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.1/distributions.html) and then calculating KL divergence for those distribution objects. 

- In the case when we are not using the model distillation we can use Gaussian or Laplacian NLL losses for all the regression outputs. For all the Multihypothesis strategies we can implement a basic-winner-to-take-all loss. 

- If we try to train for more than one task, the total loss can be calculated by summing all the losses for the tasks or task-loss balancing strategies can be implemeneted for refine results.  

## Data pipeline @nikebless
- gt_hacky — distilling existing model
- gt_real (not finished yet)

## Training pipeline

### Training loop @gauti
* GRU training logic (stopping gradients, recurrent warmup, resetting after each segment)
* Visualization of predictions vs GTs
* Wandb

* General: 
  * A batch from the dataloader consists of stacked frames, groundtruth of plans and plan probabilities and a tensor which will define when a segment is finished. 
  * Recurrent state of the GRU and desire are intialized with zeros. 
  * Traffic convention is initialized as a one-hot vector with LHD.
*

- How we create batches (mention requirement of 1 CPU per 1 sample)

## How to Use

### System Requirements @nikebless
